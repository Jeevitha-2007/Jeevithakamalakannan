Write a program using switch case which takes a value and prints the respective Size.
If size is 29 then its small

If size is 30 then its Medium

If size is 38 then its Large

If size is 42 then its XLarge

If size is not any of the above then Invalid.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int size;
    cout<<"enter the size";
    cin>>size;
    switch(size){
        case 29:
   
            cout<<"size is small";
            break;
     
        case 30:
       
            cout<<"size is medium ";
            break;
          
        case 38:
       
            cout<<"size is large ";
            break;
            
        case 42:
        
        
            cout<<"size is xlarge ";
            break;
            
        default:
        cout<<"invalid input";
        break;
            
    }
    return 0;
}
